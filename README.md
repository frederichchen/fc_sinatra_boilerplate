My Sinatra Boilerplate With Bootstrap
========================================

This is a simple boilerplate for my sinatra applications. It applies the modular way to use sinatra and integrates Twitter Bootstrap and Haml to render the views.


Directories
--------------

This boilerplate has three folders on top. The app/ directory folder, which contains three subdirectories, controllers, helpers and views, can have ruby files in it; the config/ folder can have configuration files such as database configuration files; the public/ folder can have static files such as stylesheets, JavaScripts, Images in it.


Dependencies
--------------

This boilerplate requires at least three gems: sinatra, bundler and thin.


Execution
--------------

Just type "rackup -p 4567" in a console
